# EPCC7

The repository stores the prototype code of the EPCC software development Group 7. Because the project is too large, each part is just a compressed package. Decompression operations need to be performed separately. The website address of the prototype is as follows:



[Front website](http://8.208.16.63/)

[Back stage management system website](http://8.208.16.63:8080/)


Distribution and introduction of all files of the branch:

- `BackendAPI folder`
